  #### Image Deresolution Script
  - This script creates a deresolution face dataset for you!
  
  #### Streamlit Image Classifier
  
  - The source folder contains all the code for the implementation of the algorithm, and model
  
  - Model used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Libraries used: Tensorflow, and Keras
    
##### Steps to start the Server
    
  1. Open up Anaconda3 command prompt or regular command prompt
  
  2. Install all dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install pipenv

## Credits

All the credits for making this project goes to [Hermes Bonilla](https://github.com/HermesBonilla) for making this, and I have just modified the project structure for better conventions, and also modifying the frontend looks, the predictions, and the resources too.
