# CNN Image Detection webapp

**Note**: The project github repo name has been changed to ensure this does not collide with my
such projects in the future. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Contents
  #### Image Deresolution Script
  - This script creates a deresolution noisy face dataset for you!
  
  #### Image Classifier
  
  - The `app` folder contains the implementation for loading models, and predicting images.
  
  - Model used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Libraries used: Tensorflow, and Keras
    
## Installation and usage.

This project uses `pipenv` for dependency management. You need to ensure that you have `pipenv`
installed on your system.

Here's how to install the dependencies, and get started.

- Install it using **`pipenv sync -d`**
- Once done, run the webapp using **`pipenv run start`**

And It'll start on Port 8501 by default, plus it opens the site too on webbrowser.

## Credits

All the credits for making this project goes to [Hermes Bonilla](https://github.com/HermesBonilla) for making this, and I have just modified the project structure for better conventions, and also modifying the frontend looks, the predictions, and the resources too.
